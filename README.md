This README outlines how to run our code.

This github repository contains code to run our React application. We used Create React App (https://create-react-app.dev/) to generate the original files, the instructions to run the application are below. To run our code, use the command `npm start` in the main directory. It needs to be run locally since we have not deployed the application.

We used 3rd party libraries and packages that need to be installed through npm:
1) mui
2) mui/icons-material
3) react-router-dom
4) react-iframe

The HTML pages in the application are based on the static HTML we developed for this Checkpoint. Certain aspects from the Figma and the static HTML were not perfectly replicated, given the restraints of Material UI and React in general. To run and view the application, all of the files from the Github must be downloaded to the same folder on a local desktop. Then, they should be easily viewable. 

The general flow of the application is: 
1) Log in to go to the homepage, where the child's location is currently in neutral status.
2) To see the safe zone, click on the left, and to see the danger zone, click the right.
3) From the navigation bar, users can go to other pages including: Edit Mode, Alerts, and Help Options.

Note: The application currently is for the Parent side of the product. For time constraint reasons, we did not build the application for the Child version, since they would be almost identical, with small changes in wording that can be seen through the Figma prototype.
